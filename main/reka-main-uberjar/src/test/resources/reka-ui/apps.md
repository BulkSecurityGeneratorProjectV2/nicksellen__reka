### these are the applications available to you

they are not _running_ yet

pressing **deploy** will create a new deployment of that application

once started, it'll appear in the [**running** section](/)

you can start multiple instances of the same application, at the moment the HTTP ports will clash and you'll only see the most recently deployed one.

in the future you'll be able to provide _deployment options_, such as the port to run on.
